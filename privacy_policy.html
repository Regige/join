                legal bases of the
                GDPR on which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the
                GDPR, national data
                protection regulations may apply in your or our country of residence or domicile. Furthermore,
                if more specific
                legal bases are relevant in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the privacy policy.

                    implementation of
                    pre-contractual measures taken at the data subject's request.</li>
                <li><strong>Legitimate Interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR)</strong> - Processing is necessary for the

                    interests are overridden
                    by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require

                the GDPR, national regulations on data protection apply in Germany. This includes, in
                particular, the Federal Data
                Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz â€“ BDSG). The BDSG contains specific provisions, in
                particular, on the right
                to access, the right to erasure, the right to object, the processing of special categories of
                personal data, the
                processing for other purposes, and the transmission and automated individual decision-making,
                including profiling. In
                addition, state data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.</span>
